This is a project made by Group 3: Casey Chartier, Derek Hoye, Doug Schulte, and Justin Thon.

The project's name is youpedia, and we used Javascript, Jquery, CSS, and HTML to display content from both Youtube and Wikipedia on the same page. We hope that this helps to more quickly research any given topic by both listening and reading.

The application is deployed at https://mustybraid.github.io/BootcampProjectOne/
